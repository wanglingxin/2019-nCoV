# 2019-nCoV
This repo holds the code for crawling the **latest news** on the pneumonia virus from Clove doctor's [website](https://3g.dxy.cn/newh5/view/pneumonia)

[中文](https://github.com/mathors/2019-nCoV/blob/master/README-cn.md) | [English](https://github.com/mathors/2019-nCoV)

The content of the crawling includes the number of confirmed cases, the number of suspected cases, the progress of relevant research (source of infection, route of transmission, etc.), the number of infected cases in various provinces and the latest 3 real-time news

If you don't see your province in an infected province, it may be because no cases have been found, but that doesn't mean you can let your guard down

- Updated crawler location elements

### :rocket:ABOUT

This project was written by me after staying up late for 2 hours in the evening. I just hope to call on all of you to give full play to your strengths, use what you have learned and do something within your capacity for the prevention and control of the epidemic. You can say that my project is rubbish, but please don't say that I am trying to make a show. No Chinese would make a show of this kind of thing

### :tada:TODO

My power is limited, you can help optimize the code to make it simpler, or you can do some awesome projects, such as data visualization of epidemic transmission. I will also continue to improve the project, welcome to ask more questions. Thanks

I'll soon deploy the data I've crawled to the server as json, so you can call it
